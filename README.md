# The Quiz Project 

The Quiz Project is a mini quiz game -- Smart Quiz -- designed for people who are looking for a quick and fun way to test their general knowledge in terms of science and history.

## UX

### Project Goals
 
Smart Quiz main target is the people with a basic and above general knowledge in science and history. In the nearest future other categories related to intellectual knowledge will be added. The game is aimed to offer a straight forward and easy way to test your knowledge; something that can be done, for example, while waiting at the bus stop.

### Users Goals

* A game that can be fun and challenging in the same time.
* A straight forward path to start the quiz, without navigating throught different menus.
* A quiz that will have just educational categories, rather than lifestyle or main stream categories.
* A way to contact the products developer in case of any suggestions, complaints or any other relevant topics. 
* A way to follow the developer on social media. In this case you will be on track with new potential releases or updates.
* A quiz with different outcomes, depending on how many answers are right or wrong.
