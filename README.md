The Quiz Project is a mini quiz game -- Master Quiz -- designed for people who are looking for a quick and fun way to test their general knowledge in terms of science and history.

## UX

### Project Goals
 
Smart Quiz main target is the people with a basic and above general knowledge in science and history. In the nearest future other categories related to intellectual knowledge will be added. The game is aimed to offer a straight forward and easy way to test your knowledge; something that can be done, for example, while waiting at the bus stop.

### Users Goals

## Design choices 

The goal of the app is to offer the users an easy and quick way to play the quiz. Therefore I have chosen a very simple and clear design without creating for the user potential distractions, especially when in the middle of the game.

### Fonts:
I chose to use [LATO](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lato) as a main font for the entire app. In my opinion it is a clear and easy to read font and I believe it is especially important for displaying the questions in this font. In this case the user will be able to quickly read and understand the text, his only being focus on the right answer.

I chose to use [BALSAMIQ SANS](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Balsamiq+Sans?query=balsamiq) for the main title and the name of the category display, both being h1 elements. Although I wanted to keep a simple and clear design, I believe that for the main titles, having large font sizes, it will still be very easy to read by everyone and in the same time it will give a bit of "artistic" touch  to the game, making it more attractive for the eye and "friendly" for the user.

I chose to use [MONTESARRAT](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat) for the call-to-action buttons because, in my opinion, it is similar to lato (but in the same time with small differences) and will help in keeping the uniformity of the game.

### Icons: 

I used the [TROPHY](https://fontawesome.com/icons/trophy?style=solid) icon from [FONT AWSOME](https://fontawesome.com/) to diplay the player's reward, in this way the user will have a more clear and significant image of the reward.

### Colors:

I have used worm and soft colors for the project as I wanted to protect the user from eye fatigue due to long exposure to bright colors on the screen. This may also lead to longer experiences of the user with the game.

* Primary: **Light Blue** #7fe7dc. I chose this as a main color because covering most of the viewport at all section, in my opinion, it fits to be a warm and in the same time happy and to a certain level bright color. It will help in keeping the player relaxed and exited.

* Secondary: **Shade of Dark Blue** #316879. I chose this color for the center container because it is close to the main color, in the same time providing the sufficient contrast in relation to the rest of the page. It makes the app clear and uniform.

* Tertionary color: **Orange** #f47a60. I chose this color for call-to-action buttons because it provides the optimal contrast from the rest of the colors, making the buttons stand up on the viewport. As a result it makes the app more intuitive.

* Text color: **Light Grey** #ced7d8. This color makes the text visible in contrast with the dark blue and orange used for the center container and buttons, makinging it easy to read. It's warm shade of light grey contributes to the uniformity of the app.

I have also used **Green** rgb(6, 191, 43) and **Red** rgb(153, 43, 43) for the color of the text displayed when answering the question, as they they have the same global significance indicating good or wrong outcomes.

### Background:

I have chosen not to use any background images throughout the entire game, because I believe that the combination of colors used is sufficient to keep the player focused and excited, without additional distractions or features.
