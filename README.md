# The Quiz Project 

The Quiz Project is a mini quiz game -- Master Quiz -- designed for people who are looking for a quick and fun way to test their general knowledge in terms of science and history.

## UX

### Project Goals
 
Smart Quiz main target is the people with a basic and above general knowledge in science and history. In the nearest future other categories related to intellectual knowledge will be added. The game is aimed to offer a straight forward and easy way to test your knowledge; something that can be done, for example, while waiting at the bus stop.

### Users Goals

* A game that can be fun and challenging in the same time.
* A straight forward path to start the quiz, without navigating throught different menus.
* A quiz that will have just educational categories, rather than lifestyle or main stream categories.
* A way to contact the products developer in case of any suggestions, complaints or any other relevant topics. 
* A way to follow the developer on social media. In this case you will be on track with new potential releases or updates.
* A quiz with different outcomes, depending on how many answers are right or wrong.

## Design choices 

The goal of the app is to offer the users an easy and quick way to play the quiz. Therefore I have chosen a very simple and clear design without creating for the user potential distractions, especially when in the middle of the game.

### Fonts:
I chose to use [LATO](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lato) as a main font for the entire app. In my opinion it is a clear and easy to read font and I believe it is especially important for displaying the questions in this font. In this case the user will be able to quickly read and understand the text, his only being focus on the right answer.

I chose to use [BALSAMIQ SANS](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Balsamiq+Sans?query=balsamiq) for the main title and the name of the category display, both being h1 elements. Although I wanted to keep a simple and clear design, I believe that for the main titles, having large font sizes, it will still be very easy to read by everyone and in the same time it will give a bit of "artistic" touch  to the game, making it more attractive for the eye and "friendly" for the user.
